        Outage of the Care-Link Web Application


Issue Summary:
Duration: Start Time: May 5, 2024, 10:00 UTC | End Time: May 5, 2024, 13:00 UTC
Impact: The Care-Link web application experienced intermittent downtime, with users unable to access patient records or schedule appointments. Approximately 30% of users were affected, leading to frustration and potential delays in patient care.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the MongoDB database caused a sudden spike in read requests, overwhelming the database server and leading to performance degradation.
Timeline:
10:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alert of increased database read latency.
10:15 UTC: Engineering team initiated investigation, suspecting a database issue.
10:30 UTC: Misleading path: Initially assumed network latency, investigated network configuration.
11:00 UTC: Misleading path: Investigated application code for potential bugs.
11:30 UTC: Issue escalated to database administrator for further analysis.
12:00 UTC: Database administrator identified misconfiguration in MongoDB causing increased read requests.
13:00 UTC: Issue resolved by reconfiguring MongoDB to distribute read requests evenly.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in MongoDB caused read requests to be processed inefficiently, leading to a spike in database latency.
Resolution: Database configuration was adjusted to distribute read requests more evenly across available resources, resolving the performance degradation.




Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes: Regular auditing of database configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
Specific Tasks:
Implement automated monitoring for database performance metrics.
Conduct regular database performance audits to identify and rectify potential issues.
Improve documentation for database configuration best practices to prevent future misconfigurations.
This postmortem highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and regular audits to identify and resolve issues before they impact users. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to ensure the stability and reliability of the Care-Link web application for all users.
